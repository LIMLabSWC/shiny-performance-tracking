# Shiny Performance Tracking

A pipeline for extracting, processing, and visualizing rodent behavioral training data using R and Shiny.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This project supports labs running experiments via **BControl** or **Bpod**, enabling them to:

* Convert raw `.mat` files into `.rds` for easier handling
* Extract and clean session-level data automatically
* Visualize training progress and performance metrics interactively
* Deploy the analysis as a Shiny web app
